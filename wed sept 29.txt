A hudsonica hypotheses/research questions:
full factorial design 
4 treatment groups- AA, AH, HA, HH, varying time points (f0, f2, f4, f11)
individual and then additive or synergistic effect
time series/PCA (allele freq, expression)
compare all across F0 and F4
look at raw data--> decide how to clean--> look at data again once cleaned
